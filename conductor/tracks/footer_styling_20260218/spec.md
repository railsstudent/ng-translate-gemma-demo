# Specification: Footer Component & Global Styling

## Overview

This is the foundational track for the application's visual identity. It establishes the global theme and adds a comprehensive footer to the root component.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Global Styling:**
    * Apply a global background color to the application.
    * Background color: `bg-indigo-600`.
    * Set the default text color to white across the entire application.

2. **Footer Component Content:**
    * **Left Section:**
        * Copyright Symbol and Current Year: `<copyright icon> <YYYY>` (dynamically generated).
        * Author Name: "Connie Leung".
    * **Center Section:**
        * Technical Stack List: "Angular", "Transformers.js".
    * **Right Section:**
        * GitHub Icon.
        * Repository Name: "ng-translate-gemma-demo".
        * Behavior: Clickable link that opens in a new browser tab.

3. **Placement:**
    * The footer must be integrated into the `AppComponent`'s inline template, ensuring it is pinned to or appears at the bottom of the page.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Styling:**
    * Framework: Tailwind CSS.
    * Layout: Flexbox (`flex`, `justify-between`, `items-center`).
    * Background: `bg-indigo-500` or `bg-indigo-600`.
    * Text: `text-white`.
    * Responsiveness: The footer should adjust for mobile devices (e.g., center alignment or vertical stacking if the screen is too narrow).

## Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] Application background is set to indigo (500 or 600) with white text.

* [ ] Footer component is created and displays authorship, copyright, and stack.
* [ ] The current year is correctly generated by JavaScript.
* [ ] The GitHub link opens the correct repository in a new tab.
* [ ] The layout is responsive and centered using Flexbox.
